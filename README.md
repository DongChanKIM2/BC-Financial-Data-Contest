## Feedback

This is my first time to won the big data contest

I've heard that more than 200 teams participated, and I was very happy to get the result of being third among them

Looking at the announcement of the first and second winners, I noticed that there is a difference

They thought a lot about how to use the results more than I do

Anyway, I am so happy to get my first prize and thanks to 태균, 세현
